Scripts are designed to record system performance data and output them to a plain text file.

The following five sections outline how to run and manage the live_trend programs listed in the trendprograms/ folder.
See the comment block at the head of each program in the trendprograms/ folder for a description of the program.

== About run_tests ==
DO NOT chmod +x run_tests
This file is meant to be run as an include to the current shell so that you can have process control over the jobs.
This file is the core to starting all jobs.
TESTS
The run_tests files starts all programs in the trendprograms/ folder which end in "_live_trend".
To disable a trend program from running simply rename the end of the file to something other than "_live_trend".
RESULTS
Each *_live_trend program will have a corresponding result named *_stats.txt in the results/ folder.
For example ./trendprograms/jvm_memory_live_trend has its result stored in ./results/jvm_memory_stats.txt.
BEHAVIOR
If there is *_live_trend jobs already running then they will be killed using the pids file and will be started again.
If the result file for the *_live_trend program already exists then run_tests will move it to a backup name and a new result file will be created.
EXAMPLE USAGE
    $ . run_tests

== About run_tests_manually ==
DO NOT chmod +x run_tests_manually
Similar to run_tests but instead of running everything automatically you must manually edit the run_tests_manually file to include live_trend programs.
This file will automatically backup result files like run_tests.
Instead of using killall_jobs program control the jobs you must utilize the jobs, fg, and bg commands to manage the jobs.
EXAMPLE USAGE
    $ . run_tests_manually

== About pids file ==
You can largely ignore this file.  It is only used by the killall_jobs program for killing all jobs at once when testing is done.
If no jobs show up by running the jobs command then you can simply clear this file.
By default the pids file is located at /tmp/live_trend_pids

== About killall_jobs ==
This program uses the pids file to kill all running jobs at once when testing is done.
This program will only kill jobs whose PID is listed in the pids file.
This program will delete the pids file after killing all jobs.
Example Usage:
    $ killall_jobs

== About view_result_file ==
This program cats the file of your choice by showing the whole file and then following future output updates (tail -f)
If you do not need this behavior then you can simply run tail -f jvm_memory_stats.txt or any other result file.
Example Usage:
    $ view_result_file ./results/jvm_memory_stats.txt

== About generate_aligned_csv_file.py ==
This program combines the results of all files which are given to it as arguments and align the timestamps producing a new list with the combined results.
When the results are combined the timestamps will be aligned.
The purpose of this is so that all data can be represented on the same graph easily.
In order to have the correct time show up in Libre office graphs you must do the following:
    Go to Tools > Options, select LibreOffice Calc > Calculate
    Ensure the Date is set to 12/30/1899.
    Then to calculate from the Unix timestamp to a local time in LibreOffice you must apply the following Cell equation where A2 is the Timestamp:
        =(A2-3600*4)/3600/24+25569
Example Usage:
    $ generate_aligned_csv_file.py jvm_memory_stats.txt jvm_oracleconnections_stats.txt open_file_descriptors_stats.txt
    $ generate_aligned_csv_file.py ./results/{1,5,15}minute_load_stats.txt
